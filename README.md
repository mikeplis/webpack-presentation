# Webpack Presentation

This is the code I used to give a presentation at SmarterTravel's Lunch and Learn on 7/12/18.

It uses a react-based presentation library called [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle). Most of the code for the presentation is in `/src/presentation.js`.

There's also a small app inside `/app` that I used to test out my code to make sure it was correct.

Code examples used in the presentation are in `/src/examples`
